# palmrs-database test data

## hello.prc

Compiled version of the Hello World application from the [prc-tools-remix][]
source code (at `/tools/hello-world-app` in the repository), in turn taken
from the ["Linux Palm Developer's Quick Start Guide" on tldp.org][palmdevqs].

This file was compiled using `prc-tools-remix` v2.3.5, from what I can only
assume is public-domain source code.

## tWmanual.pdb

The PalmDoc-formatted user manual for [tejpWriter][], taken from the v3.50b15
release (file found, with the same name, in the root of the original archive:
[mirror][tejpWriter-350b15-mirror]).
